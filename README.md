This repository has a configured [`.devcontainer`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial) for use with Visual Studio Code to make it easy to get involved.

In the scripts directory, a useful `tegrastats` emulator script from the [jetson_stats](https://github.com/rbonghi/jetson_stats) has been added
as a good means of testing your changes (until formal unit tests are added). To utilize this script use the command
```shell
go run cmd/jetson_exporter.go --tegrastats.path $PWD/scripts/tegrastats
```
